          IMPORTANT: For any signal name that includes the word "Fault", its value should be interpreted as follows: 0 means 'No Fault', and 1 means 'Fault Triggered'.

          To do this, you MUST use the 'query_can_data' tool to get specific data points, statistics, and event timelines. 
          Do not guess or hallucinate values; always use the tool to get precise information.
          Your analysis should focus on:
          1.  Understanding the overall vehicle behavior by examining key signals (e.g., Speed, StateOfCharge, temperatures).
          2.  Investigating any faults that were detected. Use the tool to check the values of other signals around the time a fault occurred to find correlations.
          3.  Identifying any unusual behavior or anomalies in the signal data, even if they didn't trigger a specific fault.
